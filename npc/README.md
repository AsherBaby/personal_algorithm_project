### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Find the shortest Hamiltonian path.

Traveling Salesman Problem is slightly explored here. A DP solution with O ( n^2 * 2^n ) is developed just to taste the hardness of a NP-Complete problem.

### Bin Packing
You have n items and m bins, each item i weighs w[i]. Each bin can at most hold W weights. Is there a solution?

---
### Knapsack
You have n items and each item values v[i] and weighs w[i]. Find a
subset of n items that have total weight less or equal than W and have value greater or equal than V.

---
### Subset Sum
Given a set of integers, does there exist a subset with sum exactly equal to B?

Note: 2-sum is a O(n) problem

---
### Machine scheduling
M machines and N jobs. Can you schedule them to finish them in time?

---
### Integer linear programming
Integer linear programming is in NP-Complete, nevertheless, linear programming is in P.

---
### SAT
The first known NP-Complete problem.

---
### Clique
Given a graph G(V, E). Does there exist of set of k vertices so that each vertex is adjacent to all the other.

Note: this requires adjacency not only connectivity.

---
### Longest path
Contract to shortest path, but is NPC.


---
