Inversion Count of Two Arrays

Inversion count of two arrays implemented with Divide and Conquer
algorithm, with O(n log(n)) time complexity.

Example:

    A = [1, 3, 2]
    B = [2, 3, 1]
    #inv is 3.

The smaller #inv, the more similar of the two arrays.

This algorithm can be used for recommendation system.

Inverted Index

For a content-based recommendation algorithm, suppose there are m
movies, n users. The basic algorithm takes O( n(m^2) ) running time
to find the most similar user for one user. Using inverted index,
the running time can be optimized to O ( nm ).
