## Pei Zhao's personal algorithm project

My personal algorithm project covers multiple topics, including sorting,
searching, graphs, strings, np_complete (NPC problem), operating_systen ,mapreduce, and system_design.

---
### sorting

- key indexed counting
- radix sort

---
### searching

- bloomfilter

---
### graphs

- various graph adjacency list representations
- connected components
- backtracking
- Dijkstra
- All pairs shortest paths

---
### strings

- recommendation algorithms
- KMP
- flip bits

---
### npc

- 2 SAT
- TSP

---
### operating system

- Multithreading

---
### mapreduce

- anagrams
- inverted index
- top ten
- word count

---
### system design

- rate Limiter
- tiny url

### math

- matrix
